    As I stated on the previous page I am an Avid World of Warcraft Player who has achieved many very high parses during my short time raiding.
    <img src="./Images/Raszgeth Kill.png" alt="Guild after killing Raszageth">
    Pictured here me with my guild after killing Raszageth the Storm-Eater on Mythic Difficulty.
    I'll include a link to my <a href="https://www.warcraftlogs.com/character/id/71759042">Warcraft Logs</a> for anybody interested in seeing my parses and my guild.

    Beyond just playing WoW I play various other games and have been praciticng html doing websties such as this one. I also occasionally go on hikes and go sailing with my family and I'll make sure to include pictures when I have more!
